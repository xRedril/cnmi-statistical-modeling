Overview:
For the files that have successfully converted, given the input files that were provided they can accurately return the output files necessary. My strength relies on the programming aspect of the work and my weakness is the mathematical portion. This led to several challenges for me trying to convert some of the equations that were provided in R code. On top of this there are no libraries that provide lmoments methods like there are in R which added another layer of difficulty. I tried my hardest to convert the equations referencing the documentation provided however, since my math level is not as high as required for this work I struggled. With that being said, if I were able to work with someone who can explain the mathematical portion to me then I could easily convert the rest of the files quickly.
