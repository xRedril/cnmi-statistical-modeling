# CNMI Statistical Modeling

For the files that have successfully converted, given the input files that were provided
 they can accurately return the output files necessary. My strength relies on
  the programming aspect of the work and my weakness is the mathematical portion.
   This led to several challenges for me trying to convert some of the equations
    that were provided in R code. On top of this there are no libraries that provide
     lmoments methods like there are in R which added another layer of difficulty. 
     I tried my hardest to convert the equations referencing the documentation provided
      however, since my math level is not as high as required for this work I struggled.
       However, I understand the general workflow of converting these files. With that being said, if I were able to work with someone who can explain the
        mathematical portion to me then I could easily convert the rest of the files
         quickly.
